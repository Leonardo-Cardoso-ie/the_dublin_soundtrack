            <p><strong>A cosmopolitan city</strong>, nationalities, colours and sounds, this is how we can define
                <strong>Dublin.</strong>
                Summer is comming, sun, light and a little more human warmth. We went through difficult times, without
                being able to put on our best smile that was hidden behind our masks. We also couldn't hear the music,
                that was echoed from the four corners of our city because they were silenced by the confinment and
                distance between us.
                Times are different, almost like back to normal and to celebrate this moment, we are going<strong> to
                    record a collection</strong>, entitled: <strong>The Dublin Soundtrack</strong>, with 21 original
                songs and we are inviting you, professional musician or not, bands, solo, you who play rock music,
                reggae, folk, pop, or any musical style, let's get together and you can be the big winner and have your
                single recorded by the giant<strong> label Gisela Records!</strong> <strong>Find out more</strong </p>
